# RIPE-ASN-lookup
This project identifies all ASNs for any given country code (cc) and determines the associated IP prefixes, checking which are advertised. Initially inspired by an interest in the ASNs and IP prefixes for the Faroe Islands (FO), this tool uses RIPE NCC data to provide insights into IP address allocations and advertisement status.
